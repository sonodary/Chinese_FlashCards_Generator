There are two modes to study Chinese.

In the first one, you can study most frequently used Chinese words. 
In the second one, you can create original Chinese flash cards by giving some Chinese texts as an input.

While using the flash words, you can check the translation by hitting flip or pinyin by hitting Pinyin.
If you remember the word, click the green button and save. The word will be deleted from the flash card.
If you couldn't remember, click the red button, and you can go to the next card.
